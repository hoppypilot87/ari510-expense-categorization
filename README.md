# Automated Expense Categorization (AI 510 Project)

## Overview
This repository contains our course project for **ARI 510: Machine Learning** at the University of Michigan–Flint.  
The goal is to build a machine learning system that automatically classifies financial transactions into spending categories (e.g., groceries, dining, utilities, transportation).  

## Objectives
- Apply the full ML pipeline: data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.  
- Compare multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).  
- Explore extensions such as expense prediction or fraud detection.  

## Data Sources
We plan to use publicly available datasets from **Kaggle** and the **UCI ML Repository**, including:  
- *Kaggle Personal Finance Dataset* – transactions with labeled categories.  
- *Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset* – potential extension for fraud-related tasks.  
Synthetic data may also be generated to augment underrepresented categories.
